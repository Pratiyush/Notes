See JEP 320 for more info. (JEP - JDK Enhancement Proposal)

Use Below dependencies to use JAXB to generate models:

```xml
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
			<artifactId>jaxb-core</artifactId>
			<version>3.0.2</version>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.sun.xml.bind</groupId>
			<artifactId>jaxb-impl</artifactId>
			<version>3.0.2</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

 JAXB
 -------
 JAXB - Java Architecture for XML Binding 
 
 * Way to bind XML schemas and Java representations.
 * JAXB provides methods for 
 	* unmarshalling (reading) XML instance documents into Java content trees.
 	* marshalling (writing) Java content trees back into XML instance documents.
 * JAXB also provides a way to generate XML schema from Java objects.

JAXB Architectural Overview
----------------------------

**JAXB Architectural Components **
* **Schema compiler**: Binds a source schema to a set of schema-derived program elements. The binding is described by an XML-based binding language.
* **Schema generator**: Maps a set of existing program elements to a derived schema. The mapping is described by program annotations.
* **Binding runtime framework**: Provides unmarshalling (reading) and marshalling (writing) operations for accessing, manipulating, and validating XML content using either schema-derived or existing program elements.

The JAXB Binding Process

* **Generate classes**: An XML schema is used as input to the JAXB binding compiler to generate JAXB classes based on that schema.
* **Compile classes**: All of the generated classes, source files, and application code must be compiled.
* **Unmarshal**: XML documents written according to the constraints in the source schema are unmarshalled by the JAXB binding framework. Note that JAXB also supports unmarshalling XML data from sources other than files and documents, such as DOM nodes, string buffers, SAX sources, and so forth.
* **Generate content tree**: The unmarshalling process generates a content tree of data objects instantiated from the generated JAXB classes; this content tree represents the structure and content of the source XML documents.
* **Validate (optional)**: The unmarshalling process involves validation of the source XML documents before generating the content tree. Note that if you modify the content tree in Step 6, you can also use the JAXB Validate operation to validate the changes before marshalling the content back to an XML document.
* **Process content**: The client application can modify the XML data represented by the Java content tree by using interfaces generated by the binding compiler.
* **Marshal**: The processed content tree is marshalled out to one or more XML output documents. The content may be validated before marshalling.
