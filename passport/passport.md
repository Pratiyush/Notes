Hello Guys just want to let you different state of passport when you apply, somehow I was lucky there was no address verification even though my address was changed and wife name was added.

**What all things to keep in mind?**
* Keep buffer of 3 months at least before applying. 
* Biometric Photos are not accepted in passport application. Required size is 50x50mm.
* Please check twice before selecting the Police station as selection of wrong Police station would cause delay.
* Please write cover letter with details of documents provided.
* In case you donâ€™t have the Permanent Address on your name, you could provide supporting documents. For instance, I provided Electricity Bill on my Mother's name + Passport Copy, My Aadhar Card + Father's Aadhar Card and Marriage Certificate had my Original Home address. It is worth mentioning in cover letter.

I applied via POST on 2021-05-16 through IGCS they take a quite some time to start the process.

**Status of Passport with Date (Without Address Verification):**
* 2021-06-10 - Application Form Submitted
* 2021-06-10 - Granting Initiated
* 2021-06-10 - Application Granted on No verification basis
* 2021-06-10 - Print Initiated
