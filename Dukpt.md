DUKPT - Derived Unique Key Per Transaction

* DUKPT is a key management scheme in which for every transaction, a unique key is used which is derived from a fixed key.
* DUKPT is specified in **ANSI X9.24 part 1**
* DUKPT is not itself an encryption standard; rather it is a key management technique.
* DUKPT each device is initialized with a distinct key, all of the initialization keys of an entire family of devices are derived from a single key, the base derivation key (BDK).

Keys
--------
The algorithm needs an initial single key official-sounding wayâ€”Base Derivation Key (or BDK).
