Cypress
----------
Over the past few days, I have been playing around with cypress, and it has been an enriching experience. I have been doing end-to-end testing for a few years now, but working with cypress has been a different experience altogether. I have try cypress testing with an sample todo app in react.

Cypress is opensource next-gen front-end testing tool specifically developed for modern web apps(React, Vue, Angular). Cypress End To End test makes it incredibly easy for users to debug and write. We have capability of mocking or manupalaing the application traffice or api calls from frontend to backend or vice versa.

Most of the modern testing tools including selenium run outside the browser and uses remote command to interact with it. On the other hand, Cypress operates directly within a web browser. 

Optional: Cypress currently has more than 30K starts, around 2K Fork(1) in Github which is way more than Selenium(2). Cypress lets user wirte or debug quality test easily.

---------
1. What plugines are used in cypress? Is is used with Cucumber or something?
2. What is the technology stack used in testing apart of cypress?
3. How many other testers are working in the team? Is there differnt Scrum team for tester?
